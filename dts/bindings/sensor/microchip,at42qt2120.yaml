include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  change-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Active low state change interrupt pin. Requires an
      external pull-up resistor.

  acquisition-time:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Maximum 0xFF value in units of 16ms. Determines time
      between key acquisitions.

  toward-touch-drift:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      Maximum 0x8F value in units of 160ms. Determines
      drift compensation rate of object moving toward
      sensor.

  away-touch-drift:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Maximum 0x8F value in units of 160ms. Determines
      drift compensation rate of object moving away from
      sensor.

  detection-integrator:
    type: int
    default: 4
    description: |
      Number of consecutive measurements required
      to confirm a key press.

  touch-recal-delay:
    type: int
    default: 255
    description: |
      Maximum 0xFF value in units of 160ms. Determines
      the length of time to recalibrate the touch pad
      in case an object remains in contact.

  drift-hold-time:
    type: int
    default: 25
    description:
      Maximum 0xFF value in units of 160ms. Determines time
      drift is halted after key detection.

  charge-time:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Prolongs the charge-transfer period of
      acquisition by 1 us per count.
